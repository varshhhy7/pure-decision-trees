## Title

**Pure Decision Trees: Python Implementation from Scratch**

***

## Project Overview

Brief description of what the project is and why you built it.

> This project implements Decision Trees for classification from scratch in pure Python. It covers essential splitting criteria such as Gini, Entropy, and Information Gain, and demonstrates complete tree building, training, and prediction workflows.

***

## Features

- Pure Python implementation (no external ML libraries)
- Supports Gini, Entropy, Information Gain for splits
- Clean Jupyter Notebook demonstrating usage
- Includes example datasets (UCI Heart Disease)
- Step-by-step code with explanations

## Installation

Describe how to set up the repo (e.g., cloning, requirements).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/varshhhy7/pure-decision-trees.git
cd pure-decision-trees
# (optionally set up a virtual environment)
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if a requirements.txt exists
```

***

## Usage

Instructions to run notebooks or scripts.

- Open `Classification_tree.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
- Follow cells step-by-step to see tree construction, training, and predictions.
- Example datasets (`heart_disease_uci.csv`, `cleveland.data`) included.
